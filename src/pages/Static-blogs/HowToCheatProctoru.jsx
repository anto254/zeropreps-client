                                        We have documented in quite a number of our blogs how easy it is to cheat on ProctorU exams. We were also keen to highlight that most of the popular methods discussed on online platforms highly depend on some level of luck for them to work. At Zeropreps, we don’t endorse the use of these methods, as one single mistake may land you in problems and you may find yourself unable to continue with your academic journey. The information contained in this article is solely for educational purposes.                                    </p>

                                        At Zeropreps, we have our distinctive method to help you pass any ProctorU exam. Though it may cost you a little bit more than what is common in the market right now, you get the value for your money. We assure you of privacy, quality, and security assurance. However, we acknowledge that some of you like finding your own paths while trying to pass exams. That is why we think it is appropriate to discuss a few methods that you can use to beat Proctoru.
                                        We will not, however, dwell much on some <a href="https://zeropreps.com/blog/debunking-old-methods-used-to-cheat-on-proctoru-exams" target="_blank" className="text-blue-500"> old methods that students discovered decades ago</a>, some are also easily detected by ProctorU.

                                                ●	Leveraging AI, ChatGPT and HDMI Splitters to cheat on ProctorU
                                            </h1>
                                            <p>
                                                <a href="https://zeropreps.com/blog/can-you-cheat-on-a-proctoru-exam-using-an-hdmi-splitter" target="_blank" className="text-blue-500">Can ProctorU detect HDMI splitters?</a> We discussed this and pointed out that some level of luck is needed to pass ProctorU's pre-proctoring check. So, we will assume that you have already been able to sneak an HDMI splitter into your working area and that you are being watched by a less concerned proctor. <a href="https://zeropreps.com/blog/how-to-cheat-on-aleks-a-proctoru-based-guide" target="_blank" className="text-blue-500">Our ALEKS exams guide also focused on a number of concerns you may have about how HDMI splitters work</a>. Have a look at it as the same applies to all other Proctoru exams.
                                            </p>
                                            <br />
                                            <p>
                                                Most of the exams conducted on ProctorU have a simple structure, and finding answers to the multiple-choice questions can be fairly straightforward using ChatGPT. The use of HDMI splitters must be accompanied by a test helper and an extra monitor. If the questions contain complicated mathematical formulas that your test helper cannot write onto the ChatGPT prompt window, they (test-helper) can simply use Chegg, as it is also a straightforward platform.

                                                ●	Use of a Test-helper located in another part of the globe
                                            </h1>
                                            <p>
                                                Although we have not practically tested this method and are not experts in it, we believe it can be done and is probably being done if you get everything right. You need several things for this to work:
                                            </p>
                                            <br />
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    ●	<span className="font-bold">IP proxy</span>: ProctorU records the location of the test-taker, so getting residential proxies for your test-helper is crucial for this method to work. We caution you against using VPNs as they are easily detected. Make sure the test-helper IP location matches the location ProctorU expects you to take your exam from. There are also numerous applications that can help you mock your geographical location, the test-helper should mock their location to appear as if they are located whether the student lives.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    ●	<span className="font-bold">Clone Government or school ID</span>: Fake IDs can lead to your test being flagged, however, you can find services online that can guide you on how to make clean cloned documents. Make sure the test-helper's face is the one that appears on your ProctorU profile. During the exam, the idea is to have the test-helper pass the identity check by presenting the cloned ID that contains the student's personal details, except with their own face on the ID to match what is in the profile.
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>
                                                Finally, it's important to ensure that your test-helper is well-versed in the test you are taking. There are many risks involved here, and the last thing you want is to pay for a risky service and still not pass the exam.

                                                ●	Cheat on ProctorU with Ventoy
                                            </h1>
                                            <p>
                                                ProctorU is able to detect virtualization techniques. Proctors deploy scripts that help them detect virtual assistance or emulation. Ventoy, however, is a cool tool that lets you run a Windows virtual machine directly on your computer's hardware, just like it's running on VM software. So, you get all the perks of a VM, like isolation, separation, and snapshotting. The best part is, proctoring software won't even detect it because it's not emulation – you're actually running Windows on real physical hardware.

                                            <p>
                                                We can help you with the setup, although there is full documentation and everything you need available on their <a href="https://www.ventoy.net/" target="_blank" className="text-blue-500"></a> . Ventoy is unlike other virtualization tools, and we were able to test it. We can confidently say that you don't need to be tech-savvy to use it. Although our service is very different from what the Ventoy tool can achieve in terms of bypassing ProctorU's anti-cheat methods, we believe it is an option to consider if you want to explore new methods that are not yet obsolete.

                                        How can someone take my ProctorU test for me?
                                    </h1>
                                    <p>
                                        You can have someone take a ProctorU test on your behalf, but you would still need to sit in front of your desk and computer to appear as if you are the one taking it. This may require some level of skills and practice to pull through. There are two ways this can be achieved:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            ●	Have someone sneak into the room: You can have someone sneak into the room either through a second door or the main entrance but make sure they are not noticed while getting in. You will need a way to pass the exam questions to them, then they will get the answers and pass them to you. This is a very risky method and we would advise you to do enough practise to ensure you don’t get caught
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            ●	The other method is to use the HDMI splitters we have mentioned above to broadcast the screen to another room where a test helper is situated.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <br />

                                        Yes, ProctorU can detect cheating easily by utilizing various techniques.

                                            ●	Live proctoring: During live proctoring, the proctor ensures that no unauthorized materials are used. If you use gadgets like smartphones or attempt to take pictures of the test, this might be considered a cheating attempt. Proctors also monitor to ensure that you <a href="https://zeropreps.com/blog/does-proctoru-track-eye-movements" target="_blank" className="text-blue-500">maintain proper gaze and avoid any suspicious eye movements</a>. Additionally, the live proctor will verify that no additional person is present in the room.

                                        <li>
                                            ●	The proctor runs a script to detect alien software that may aid in cheating or the use of unpermitted virtual assistance before the exam is unlocked. You might be tempted to cheat on ProctorU by using the virtual assistance techniques after the proctor is done with this check and proceeds to unlock the exam for you but I must say that nothing prevents them from interrupting you if they detect the use of such in the middle of the test.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                        The proctor can tell when you open new tabs and this automatically leads to a test flag.
                                    </p>
                                    <br />

                                        ProctorU is committed to maintaining exam integrity and promoting academic honesty. As students invent new ways to beat the system, ProctorU also improves its detection techniques. You can be sure that their proctors undergo regular training to stay updated on the latest trends in ProctorU cheats techniques. Preparing well for your test and understanding how ProctorU detects cheating may put you in a position to handle your test well and excel without any challenges.

                                    <p>
                                       The use of notes during a proctored exam depends on the specific rules and guidelines set by the exam administrator or institution. In some cases, notes may be allowed, while in others, they may be strictly prohibited. It is essential to review the instructions provided for the specific exam you are taking to determine whether or not you are permitted to use notes. 
                                    </p>

                                        How does ProctorU verify identity?

                                    </h1>
                                    <p>
                                        Verifying your identity happens in the pre-proctoring stage, and it's a fairly straightforward process. The first requirement is to take a clear photo using your computer webcam. The image should capture your face to the shoulders and the chest area. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The second requirement is to take a clear photo of your valid identity card. You can provide either a driver's license or a college-issued identity card. Once you have taken the two required pictures, it is advised to wait until your assigned proctor connects.
                                    </p>
                                    <br />
                                    <h1 id="Can I use a fake ID for ProctorU?" className="font-bold text-xl text-primary" >
                                        Can I use a fake ID for ProctorU?
                                    </h1>
                                    <p>
                                        If you use a fake identity card for ProctorU, you risk being flagged. The use of unacceptable IDs falls under ProctorU’s list of unpermitted behaviors. The name on the Identity Card must fully match the name on the proctoring appointment. The proctor may, however, allow you to continue if there is a minor mismatch, but the incident will still be recorded for further review.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Besides the name on the ID not fully matching the name on the proctoring appointment, the other scenarios flagged under ‘unacceptable ID’ category include:
                                    </p>

                               No, typically you cannot take a ProctorU exam without providing a valid form of identification. ProctorU has identity verification measures in place to ensure the integrity of the exam and confirm the identity of the test-taker.

                                        The use of calculators depends on the exam type and the guidelines set by your learning institution. For example, tests like ALEKS placement tests provide test-takers with on-screen calculators, eliminating the need for an additional calculator. Other exams may allow the use of various types of calculators, such as Four Function Calculator, Scientific Calculator, Graphing Calculator, Online Calculator, and Financial Calculator. If a physical calculator is permitted, it is important to ensure that it does not have any writings or cheat sheets on it, as the proctor will need to inspect it.

                                        If you engage in any activity that breaches the integrity of the test, ProctorU will definitely flag you. <a href="https://zeropreps.com/blog/proctoru-flag-types-and-categories-of-unpermitted-behaviors" target="_blank" className="text-blue-500">We have listed the unpermitted activities that you should not engage in while taking the test. The proctors will, however, warn you before flagging you</a>. But if you persist in doing the same, they have no choice but to put a flag on the test. The proctors save the evidence of the flag, which awaits review by the test owner.

                                        Yes, scanning your testing area is one of the requirements of ProctorU during the pre-proctoring period. This step is mandatory as it assists the proctors to ensure a secure testing environment. When prompted, you will be asked to use your webcam or mobile device to scan the room, showing all angles and corners. This allows the proctors to verify that there are no unauthorized materials or individuals present that could potentially compromise the integrity of the test. Additionally, it helps to confirm that you are alone and adhering to the test guidelines. The scanning process typically takes about a minute and provides an added layer of assurance for a fair and controlled testing experience.

                                        Yes, ProctorU does capture MAC address information. This is done as part of the security measures that ProctorU uses to prevent cheating. The MAC address is a unique identifier that is assigned to every network card. By capturing the MAC address, ProctorU can identify the specific device that is being used to take the exam.

                                        What can I have with me during ProctorU exams? The exam materials you can have during a ProctorU exam depend entirely on the exam requirements and your institution's guidelines. It is good to find out what specific materials are allowed and what is prohibited beforehand. Generally, permitted materials may include essential items such as calculators, scratch paper, textbooks, or any specific resources specified by the exam instructions. However, it's important to note that electronic devices like smartphones, smartwatches, or any device capable of accessing the internet are typically not allowed, as they could potentially facilitate cheating. To ensure compliance and a smooth testing experience, familiarize yourself with the exam guidelines provided by your institution or reach out to your instructor for clarification.

Some test-takers may have a natural inclination to read the questions aloud. However, this action can be interpreted as a potential cheating tactic, where the student reads the questions to someone else who may be hiding in the room and then receives answers from them. Such behavior undermines the integrity of the exam and is strictly prohibited to ensure fair and unbiased assessment.
