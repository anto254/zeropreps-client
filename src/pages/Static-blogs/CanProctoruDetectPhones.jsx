                                        ProctorU has no mechanism to detect the presence of phones
                                        after the exam has commenced. The only measure the proctors
                                        take is to ask you to show them your phone and keep it away
                                        from your working area. The proctor will also ask you to
                                        show your room from all angles (360 degrees), so if you have
                                        an extra phone, it may be advisable to keep it in a place
                                        where they can see it when you are panning the camera.

                                        Cell phone use poses a great risk to online proctoring of
                                        exams, perhaps due to the fact that it allows for easy
                                        access to unauthorized information and communication during
                                        the exam. With the widespread availability of smartphones
                                        and their advanced capabilities, students can easily search
                                        for answers or communicate with others to gain an unfair
                                        advantage. Cell phones can be discreetly concealed or
                                        positioned out of sight, making it difficult for proctors to
                                        identify when students are using them.

                                    </h1>

                                    <p>Yes, it is possible to cheat using a phone. However, it is important to remember that during the pre-proctoring period, the proctor ensures that the test environment requirements are met. This includes verifying that the test-takers have a quiet and distraction-free room, with no access to external assistance or unauthorized materials like smartphones. The proctor instructs you to do a 360-degree camera pan, during which they will check the entire surrounding area.
                                        The proctor instructs you to put your phone away in a place where it is inaccessible and out of reach throughout the duration of the examination. </p>

                                    <p>Despite these measures, it is quite easy for a test-taker to hide an extra phone where it remains undetected by the proctor. Technology has advanced and there are creative ways to conceal devices, such as using smaller phones or hiding them in inconspicuous  locations. Most proctors just keep track of one phone and may not be concerned about an extra phone that you may hide under the desk or in one of your pockets.</p>

                                    <p>ProctorU's capabilities don't go beyond what they can see on your webcam or what is running on your computer.

This is because ProctorU uses a secure connection to your device, and they cannot see any other devices on your network</p><br />

Yes, ProctorU is capable of detecting a connection from a computer to a TV through an HDMI cable. This detection occurs during the pre-proctoring stages to prevent the usage of dual monitors. The proctor is able to accomplish this by scanning the test-taker's computer setup and identifying any external displays connected via HDMI. </p><br />

                                    <p>While some proctors may not necessarily have issues with you having a pet in your testing area, it is important to note that pets can potentially create distractions or disruptions during an exam. As a result, many institutions and exam providers may request that you maintain a pet-free environment during the test. This requirement is in place to ensure exam integrity and maintain a quiet and focused atmosphere.</p><br />

                                        Can ProctorU run out of sessions?
                                    </h1><p>
                                        Yes, ProctorU can run out of sessions during peak times, such as during the beginning and end of the school year. This is because ProctorU has a limited number of proctors available to invigilate exams. If you are unable to schedule a ProctorU session during your desired time, you may want to try scheduling your exam for a less popular time. You can also contact ProctorU support to see if they have any availability in the near future.</p><br />

                                        Can you listen to music during a ProctorU exam?
                                    </h1>
                                    <p>No, you cannot listen to music during a ProctorU exam. This restriction is in place because it is necessary to maintain a quiet environment while taking the exam to ensure fairness and minimize distractions. Additionally, the use of earphones or AirPods is also not permitted. While some students may find music helpful for concentration, <a href="https://zeropreps.com/blog/adhd-and-proctoru-challenges-posed-by-online-proctored-test-to-individuals-with-adhd" target="_blank" className="text-blue-500" >especially if they have ADHD</a>  and require music that enhances focus, unfortunately, it is not allowed during the exam to maintain consistent testing conditions for all participants.</p><br />

                                    <p>No, you cannot take a ProctorU exam before the specified time. ProctorU exams are scheduled in advance so that proctors can be available to monitor the exams. If you try to start your exam before the scheduled time, you will not be able to access the exam. If you need to take your exam early, you should contact your instructor or the proctoring service to see if they can accommodate your request.</p><br />

                                        Can ProctorU see virtual machines?
                                    </h1>
                                    <p>Yes, ProctorU has the ability to detect the usage of virtual machines and remote-control software. In one of our blog posts, <a href="https://zeropreps.com/blog/proctoru-flag-types-and-categories-of-unpermitted-behaviors" target="_blank" className="text-blue-500">we have listed unpermitted virtual assistance as an incident type that can lead to flagging of the test.</a>  However, there are instances where virtualization, if implemented well, can pass the ProctorU test. </p>
                                    <br /><p>Detection of virtual machines happens in the beginning of the session when the proctor runs or deploys a script on the test-taker’s device which analyzes the system configuration and checks for virtualization software or other indicators commonly associated with virtual machines. If the threat is detected, the test-taker is advised to end the session and reconnect with a different computer. The incident is still recorded as a flag nevertheless.</p><br />

                                    </h1>
                                    <p>You can verify if your exam was submitted by simply logging into your account. In your portal, you can see the status, and if submitted successfully, you will receive a confirmation message or notification indicating that your exam has been successfully submitted and recorded.
                                        Alternatively, you can contact your instructor or institution to confirm whether the exam was recorded successfully. </p><br />

                                    </h1>
                                    <p>Yes, you can use any email to create a ProctorU account. ProctorU does not restrict users to a certain email type. However, 'edu' domain emails are commonly used by most test-takers. This is a personal decision, but for consistency and convenience, using an 'edu' email may align with your educational institution's email domain and help streamline the verification process. Ultimately, the choice of email domain is up to you and does not affect the functionality or access to ProctorU's services.</p><br />

                                    </h1>
                                    <p>Yes, mobile hotspots can work the same as regular wifi connections, however, it is important to do an internet speed test on ProctorU and ensure that you pass it so that you don’t face technical difficulties during the exam. </p>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>To pass the internet speed test on ProctorU, the minimum download speed is 1024 kbps while the minimum upload speed is also 1024 kb</p>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>It is also good to note that cellular internet may be interrupted if your phone receives normal calls while taking the exam which may lead to disconnection. For this reason, regular wifi connections may be the best to use while taking  an online proctored exam.</p>

                                    <p>No, ProctorU does not grade exams. ProctorU is a remote proctoring service that provides video monitoring and invigilation of exams.

                                        Yes, ProctorU uses facial recognition to authenticate test takers and to detect any unauthorized persons in the testing environment. When you first take a ProctorU exam, you will be asked to provide a photo ID and to take a selfie. These images will be used to create a facial recognition profile for you. During your exam, ProctorU will use this profile to compare your face to the face in your ID photo. If the two faces do not match, you will be flagged for further review.
                                        ProctorU also uses facial recognition to detect unauthorized persons in the testing environment. For example, if someone else enters your testing area during your exam, ProctorU will be able to detect this and flag the incident.</p><br />

                                    <p>Yes, ProctorU can check your location during an exam. This is done to ensure that you are taking the exam from a permitted location. ProctorU uses a variety of methods to check your location, including IP address tracking, GPS tracking, and webcam monitoring. If ProctorU determines that you are taking the exam from an unauthorized location, you may be disqualified from the exam.</p><br />
